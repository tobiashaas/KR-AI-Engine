Document feeder / scanner
Learn about the printer document feeder and scanner components.
NOTE:
This section is for MFP printers only.
Document feeder simplex operation
Learn about document feeder operation.
The document feeder will not function when the document feeder cover is open. The paper path is 
incomplete if the document feeder cover is lifted from the glass.
When the printer duplex scans from the document feeder, the paper moves through one time, because 
the document feeder has a contact image sensor (CIS) scanner for side two which is scanned 
simultaneously with side one.
NOTE:
Duplex scanning is model specific. Some printer models might not support duplex scanning 
and printing.
The standard operation of the document feeder consists of the standby (paper loading) mode, pick, feed, 
and lift steps:
●
Standby (paper-loading) mode
In standby mode, the lift plate is in the down position. When a document is loaded into the input tray, 
the paper-present sensor detects its presence.
When a copy/scan is initiated, the document feeder motor engages the gear train and raises the lift 
plate until the document makes contact with the pick roller. The document feeder then begins the 
pick, feed, and lower sequence.
●
Pick
The pick roller rotates and moves one or more sheets forward into the document feeder where 
the sheets engage with the separation roller. The separation roller contacts the document feeder 
separation pad, which separates multiple sheets into a single sheet.
●
Feed
The single sheet continues through the document feeder paper path (aided by the pre-scan rollers) 
until the leading edge of the page activates the top-of-form sensor. Activation of this sensor initiates 
the scan process, and the scanner acquires the image as the document moves over the document 
feeder glass. The post-scan rollers then eject the sheet into the output area. The pick and feed steps 
are repeated as long as paper is detected by the paper-present sensor.
●
Home
When the top-of-form sensor detects the trailing edge of the last page, the last sheet is ejected and 
the motor turns on a sequence that rests the separation floor back down in standby mode, which 
allows it to detect when more media is loaded.
Scanning and image capture system
Learn about the scanning and image capture system.
NOTE:
This section is for MFP printers only.
Document feeder / scanner
47


--- PAGE 74 ---
The flatbed image scanner captures an electronic image of the document on the glass. The scanner 
does this by illuminating the document with LEDs (red, green, and blue) and capturing the image in the 
image sensor to create an electronic format of the document. The flatbed scanner consists of three 
main elements.
●
CIS scanner
The CIS (contact image sensor) scanner captures an image using the printer's optical path. Red, 
green, and blue LEDs sequentially illuminate a small strip of the document (often called a raster line), 
and the optical system captures each color in a single row of CCD sensors that cover the entire 
page width. Because only one color is captured for each line per exposure, the three colors are 
recombined electronically to create the full color image. For monochromatic scans or copies, all 
three LEDs are illuminated to create a white light for the scan so the raster line can be captured in 
one exposure.
●
Mechanical drive system
The drive system moves the CIS scanner along the document length to create the image. In this 
printer, the drive system consists of a small DC motor with an optical encoder, a drive belt, and 
a guide rod. The speed of the drive system is proportional to the scan resolution (300 ppi is 
much faster than 1200 ppi) and also proportional to the type of scan (color scans are slower than 
monochromatic scans).
●
Image processing system (formatter)
The formatter processes the scanner data into either a copy or a scan to the computer. For copies, 
the image data is sent directly to the printer without being transmitted to the computer. Depending 
on user selections for the copy settings, the formatter enhances the scanner data significantly 
before sending it to the printer. Image data is captured at 300 ppi for copies and is user selectable 
for scans to the computer. Each pixel is represented by 8 bits for each of the three colors (256 levels 
for each color), for a total of 24 bits per pixel (24-bit color).

Formatter-control system
Learn about how the formatter operates.
CAUTION:
Under NO circumstances should a formatter from a different printer be installed during 
the repair or troubleshooting processes. The formatter stores important data specific to the model of 
printer it is installed in and is not deigned to be swapped or repurposed in any way. Return a used 
formatter to HP.
Issues that can occur from swapping a formatter include:
●
Serial number, product number, product name, page count, and supported cartridges information 
change and might make a product unusable
●
33.02.01 Used board/Disk installed errors
If a used formatter is installed and causes this issue, the partner must cover the costs of the repair in 
the form of a product replacement. There is no method in the field to recover a printer where a used 
formatter is installed.
IMPORTANT:
When a formatter PCA or DC controller is replaced a pairing operation must be 
completed to make the printer functional.
The formatter performs the following functions:
●
Controls the sleep delay function
●
Receives and processes print data from the various printer inputs
●
Monitors control panel functions and relaying printer status information through the control panel 
and the network or bi-directional interface
●
Develops and coordinates data placement and timing with the DC controller PCA
●
Stores customer configuration settings and paper types.
●
Stores font information
●
Communicates with the host computer through the network or the bidirectional interface
The formatter receives a print job from the network or bidirectional interface and separates it into image 
information and instructions that control the printing process. The DC controller PCA synchronizes the 
image formation system with the paper input and output systems, and then signals the formatter to 
send the print image data.
Power management
Learn about printer power management.
Power management conserves power after the printer has been idle for an adjustable length of time. 
When the printer is in sleep mode, the control-panel back-light is turned off, but the printer retains all 
printer settings, downloaded fonts, and macros. Power management can be modified or turned off from 
the control-panel menus.
The printer exits sleep mode and enters the warm-up cycle when any of the following occurs.
●
A print job, valid data, or a PML or PJL command is received at the serial port.
●
A print job or fax (fax models) is received.

Printer job language (PJL)
Learn about printer job language (PJL).
PJL is an integral part of printer configuration, in addition to the standard PCL and PostScript (PS). With 
standard cabling, the printer can use PJL to perform a variety of functions.
●
Dynamic I/O switching: The printer can be configured with a host on each I/O by using dynamic 
I/O switching. Even when the printer is offline, it can receive data from more than one I/O 
simultaneously, until the I/O buffer is full.
●
Context-sensitive switching: The printer can automatically recognize the personality (PS or PCL) of 
each job and configure itself to serve that personality.
●
Isolation of print environment settings from one print job to the next: For example, if a print job is 
sent to the printer in landscape mode, the subsequent print jobs print in landscape only if they are 
formatted for landscape printing.

Over-current/over-voltage protection
Learn about LVPS protections.
The low-voltage power supply automatically stops supplying the DC voltage to the printer components 
whenever it detects excessive current or abnormal voltage. The low-voltage power supply has a 
protective circuit against over-current and over-voltage to prevent failures in the power supply circuit.
CAUTION:
If DC voltage is not being supplied from the low-voltage power supply, the protective 
function might be running. In this case, turn the power switch off and unplug the power cord.
Do not turn the power switch on until the root cause is found and corrected.
If the protective function is active, the DC controller notifies the formatter of a low-voltage power 
supply failure. In addition, the low-voltage power supply has two fuses to protect against over-current. If 
over-current flows into the AC line, the fuse stops the AC power.
Low-voltage power supply safety
Learn about LVPS safety.
For the customer and service technician safety, the printer has a function to stop +24VB power when the 
24V interlock switch is turned off. This stops the DC power supply to the following loads.
●
High-voltage power supply
●
Fuser motor
●
Pickup motor
●
Developer alienation motor
●
Duplex switchback motor
The remote switch control circuit turns on or off the printer power so that the AC power flows even if the 
power switch is turned off. Unplug the printer power cord before disassembling the printer.

Low-voltage power supply 
failure detection
When +24V is supplied from the low-voltage power supply, the DC controller always monitors 
output status of 24VA. The DC controller determines it as low-voltage power supply malfunction 
if 24VA would not become the specified value at the specified timing. When the DC controller 
monitors AC voltage input from inlet, it also determines it as low-voltage power supply 
malfunction if AC voltage input from inlet would not reach the specified voltage.
High-voltage power supply
Learn about the high-voltage power supply.
The DC controller controls the high-voltage power supply to generate high-voltage biases. The high-
voltage power supply generates the high-voltage biases that are applied to the following components:

Fuser heater protection
Learn about fuser heater protection.
The fuser heater protective function detects an excessive temperature rise of the fuser and interrupts 
power supply to the fuser heater. The printer has the following protective functions to prevent the fuser 
heater from excessive rising temperature.
●
DC controller: The DC controller constantly monitors the temperature of the thermistor. The DC 
controller stops the FUSER HEATER CONTROL signal output and turns off the relays (RL401/RL402) 
to interrupt power supply to the fuser heater when it detects an excessive temperature.
Fuser heater protection
71


--- PAGE 98 ---
●
Fuser heater safety circuit: The fuser heater safety circuit constantly monitors the temperature 
of the thermistor. The fuser heater safety circuit turns off the relays (RL401/RL402) or the triacs 
(Q409/Q410/Q411) and the fuser heater control circuit to interrupt power supply to the fuser heater 
when it detects an excessive temperature. Triac (Q409) corresponds only to the A2ODF fuser.
●
Thermal fuse (ODF fuser): Contact of the thermal fuse opens and it interrupts power supply to the 
fuser heater when the temperature of the fuser heater is abnormally high.
●
Thermoswitch (A2ODF fuser): The contact of the thermoswitch breaks to interrupt power supply to 
the fuser heater when the temperature of the fuser heater is abnormally high.

Step 2: Primary charging
Learn about the image formation primary charging step.
To prepare for latent image formation, the surface of the photosensitive drum is charged with a uniform 
negative charge. The primary charging roller receives the primary charging bias, and then the roller 
charges the drum by direct contact.
Figure 3-15 Primary charging
Photosensitive drum
Primary charging roller
Primary charging bias
Step 3: Laser-beam exposure
Learn about the image formation laser-beam exposure step.
The laser beam strikes the photosensitive drum to neutralize the negative charge on the portions of the 
drum surface where the image will form. An electrostatic latent image forms where the negative charge 
was neutralized. The neutralized areas on the drum are ready to accept toner.
Step 2: Primary charging
77


--- PAGE 104 ---
Figure 3-16 Laser-beam exposure
Step 4: Development
Learn about the image formation development step.
A developing bias is applied to the developing roller. The toner acquires a negative charge as a result 
of the friction from the developing roller rotating against the developing blade. Because the negatively 
charged surface of the photosensitive drums were neutralized where they have been struck by the laser 
beam, the toner adheres to those areas on the drums. The latent image becomes visible on the surface 
of the drum.

Step 5: Primary transfer
Learn about the image formation primary transfer step.
The toner on the photosensitive drum is transferred to the ITB. T1 bias is applied to the T1 roller to charge 
the ITB positive. The ITB attracts the negatively charged toner from the surface of each photosensitive 
drum. The complete toner image forms on the ITB.

passes through the heated and pressurized rollers in the fuser the toner melts onto the page. The toner 
image is now permanently fused to the page. A fusing bias applied to the pressure roller improves image 
quality.

Determine the problem source
When the printer malfunctions or encounters an unexpected situation, the printer control panel alerts 
the user to the situation.
This section contains a pre-troubleshooting checklist and a troubleshooting flow chart to filter out many 
possible causes of the problem.
●
Use the pre-troubleshooting check list to gather information about the problem from the customer.
●
Use the troubleshooting flowchart to pinpoint the root cause of hardware malfunctions. The 
flowchart guides you to the section of this chapter that contains steps for correcting the 
malfunction.
Before beginning any troubleshooting procedure, check the following issues:
●
Are supply items within their rated life?
●
Does the configuration page reveal any configuration errors?
NOTE:
The customer is responsible for checking supplies and for using supplies that are in good 
condition.
Pre-troubleshooting checklist
The following table includes basic questions to ask the customer to quickly help define the problem(s).
Table 4-1 Pre-troubleshooting checklist
General topic
Questions
Environment
●
Is the printer installed on a solid, level surface (+/- 1°)?
●
Is the power-supply voltage within ± 10 volts of the specified power source?
●
Is the power-supply plug inserted in the printer and the wall outlet (not a surge 
protector)?
●
Is the operating environment within the specified parameters?
●
Is the printer exposed to ammonia gas, such as that produced by diazo copiers 
or office cleaning materials?
NOTE:
Diazo copiers produce ammonia gas as part of the copying processes. 
Ammonia gas (from cleaning supplies or a diazo copier) can have an adverse 
effect on some printer components (for example, the toner cartridge or 
cartridges OPC).
●
Is the printer exposed to direct sunlight?
●
Is the printer exposed to an air conditioning or heating vent that can cause 
temperature fluctuations?
Media
●
Does the customer use only supported media?
●
Is the media in good condition (no curls, folds, or distortion)?
●
Is the media stored correctly and within environmental limits?
120
Chapter 4  Solve problems

Table 4-1 Pre-troubleshooting checklist (continued)
General topic
Questions
Input trays
●
Is the amount of media in the tray within specifications?
●
Is the media correctly placed in the tray?
●
Are the paper guides aligned with the stack (no gaps in the stack or excessive 
pressure causing the stack to bow)?
●
Is the tray (or trays) correctly installed in the printer?
Toner cartridge
●
Is the toner cartridge (or cartridges) installed correctly?
NOTE:
If country/region specific toner cartridges are available for the printer, make 
sure the correct cartridge is installed.
Transfer unit and fuser
●
Are the transfer unit and fuser installed correctly?
NOTE:
For printers with an intermediate transfer belt (ITB), is the ITB installed 
correctly and fully seated. If a replacement ITB was installed, was all of the 
packing materials removed?
Covers
●
Is the toner cartridge door closed?
Condensation
●
Does condensation occur following a temperature change (particularly in 
winter following cold storage)? If so, wipe affected parts dry or leave the printer 
on for 10 to 20 minutes.
●
Was a toner cartridge (or cartridges) opened soon after being moved from a 
cold to a warm room? If so, allow the toner cartridge (or cartridges) to sit at 
room temperature for 1 to 2 hours.
Miscellaneous
●
Check for and remove any non-HP components (toner cartridges, memory 
modules, and EIO cards) from the printer.
●
Remove the printer from the network and ensure that the failure is associated 
with the printer before beginning troubleshooting.
●
For any color print-quality issues (color printers only), calibrate the printer, and 
then print a diagnostics page to verify print quality.
Troubleshooting flowchart
This flowchart highlights the general processes to follow to quickly isolate and solve printer hardware 
problems.
Each row depicts a major troubleshooting step. Follow a “yes” answer to a question to proceed to the 
next major step. A “no” answer indicates that more testing is needed. Go to the appropriate section in

Basic printer functions should start up when the printer 
is connected into an electrical outlet and the power 
switch is pushed to the on position.
During normal operation cooling fans and/or motors 
should be operating. Place a hand over fan intake 
or exhaust vents to determine if the fan or fans are 
spinning. Lean close to the printer to hear motors 
rotating.
If fans and/or motors are operating, the dc side of the 
power supply is functioning.
Always make sure that the printer is plugged into 
a known-functioning wall receptacle. Remove power 
strips and plug the printer directly into a wall 
receptacle.
After the control panel display is functional, see step 2.

Defeating interlocks
Learn about defeating printer interlocks.
Different tests can be used to isolate different types of issues. For assembly or noise isolation, run the 
diagnostic test when the front, right or toner supply (model specific) door is open.
Defeating the door interlocks allows observation of the paper pick operation.
Defeat the front door interlock
1.
Open the front door.
2.
Insert a folded piece of paper into the slot.
TIP:
Fold a stiff piece of paper, for example a business card or index card, into a strip, and insert 
the strip into the slot for the door interlock logic switch.
It might be easier to use a small flat-blade screwdriver to defeat the door interlock.

HP Jetdirect LEDs (2 LEDs)
Indicates network activity and link status.
CAUTION:
Under NO circumstances should a formatter from a different printer be installed during 
the repair or troubleshooting processes. The formatter stores important data specific to the model of 
printer it is installed in and is not deigned to be swapped or repurposed in any way. Return a used 
formatter to HP.
Issues that can occur from swapping a formatter include:
●
Serial number, product number, product name, page count, and supported cartridges information 
change and might make a product unusable.
●
33.02.01 Used board/Disk installed errors
If a used formatter is installed and causes this issue, the partner must cover the costs of the repair in 
the form of a product replacement. There is no method in the field to recover a printer where a used 
formatter is installed.
 This part contains components that are electrostatic discharge (ESD) sensitive. To reduce the 
possibility of ESD damage, always touch the sheet-metal chassis to ground yourself before touching an 
ESD sensitive part.
Heartbeat LED
The heartbeat LED indicates that the formatter is functioning correctly. While the printer is initializing 
after it is turned on, the LED blinks rapidly, and then turns off. When the printer has finished the 
initialization sequence, the heartbeat LED pulses on and off.
The following list describes the heartbeat LED operation while the printer is executing the firmware boot 
process.
NOTE:
If after initialization, the heartbeat LED is not solid green, see Table 4-7 Heartbeat LED, printer 
operational on page 172.

Use this diagnostic test to isolate the cause of problems such as image-formation defects and jams 
within the engine.
During this test, stop the paper anywhere along the printer paper path. The test can be programmed to 
stop printing internal pages or an external print job when the paper reaches a certain position. The test 
can also be programmed to stop from 0 to 60,000 ms. If the timer is set to a value that is greater than the 
job-print time, the printer can recover in one of two ways.
Printer recovery (print/stop test)
●
After the print job is completed press the OK button to return to the Troubleshooting menu before 
the timer times out.
●
After the timer times out, touch the Stop button. Activate the door switch to restart the engine and 
return it to a normal state.
Common print/stop test timing millisecond (ms) stops
●
600 ms: The page has passed the registration area and the leading edge is just short of entering the 
fuser. The image can be seen on the paper but has not fused. If the defect is visible then the cause 
might be the drum, transfer roller, or a roller prior to, or in, the registration area.
●
1200 ms: The leading edge is about 18mm (0.71 in) into the top output bin. The image has gone 
through the fuser. If the defect was not visible prior to the fuser, and is visible after the fuser, then 
the fuser it is the likely cause of the print quality defect. Inspect the fuser for damage, debris, or 
labels stuck to the fuser. Replace the fuser. Discuss media specifications and proper care of the 
fuser with the customer.

Restore the Service ID
When replacing the formatter, the Service ID date is lost. Use this menu item to reset the date to the 
original date that the printer was first used. The date format is YYDDD. Use the following formula to 
calculate the Service ID.
Calculate the service ID
For the calculation below, the placed-in-service date is 17OCT2002.
1.
To calculate YY, subtract 1990 from the calendar year. If the printer was first used in 2002, calculate 
YY as follows: 2002 - 1990 = 19. YY = 12.
2.
Subtract 1 from 10 (October is the tenth month of the year): 10 - 1 = 9.
●
Multiply 9 by 30: 9 x 30 = 270 and add 17 to 270: 270 + 17 = 287. Thus, DDD = 287.
3.
In this example the Service ID is 12287.
Convert the Service ID to an actual date
Use the printer Service ID number to determine whether the printer is still under warranty. Use the 
following formula to convert the Service ID into the actual date the printer was placed-in-service. For the 
example below, use the Service ID previously calculated (12287).
1.
Add 1990 to YY to get the actual year that the printer was installed.
2.
Divide DDD by 30. If there is a remainder, add 1 to the result. This is the month.
3.
The remainder from the calculation in step 2 is the date.
a.
12 + 1990 = 2002, so the year is 2002.
b.
287 divided by 30 = 9 with a remainder of 17. Because there is a remainder, add 1 to 9 to get 10, 
which represents October.
c.
The remainder in step 2 is 17, so that is the date. The complete date is 17-October-2002.
NOTE:
A six-day grace period is built into the date system.

Active and repository firmware locations
The firmware bundle consists of multiple parts. The main components are the Windows CE Operating 
System and the printer/peripheral firmware files.
There are two locations/partitions on the hard drive where the firmware components are stored:
●
The Active, where the operating system and firmware currently are executing.
●
The Repository, the recovery location.
If the Active location is damaged, or a Partial Clean was performed, the printer automatically copies 
over the OS and firmware files from the Repository location and the printer recovers.
Format Disk and Partial Clean functions
277


--- PAGE 304 ---
If both the Active and Repository locations are damaged, or a Format Disk was performed, then both 
locations are gone and the error message 99.09.67 displays on the control-panel display. The user must 
upload the firmware to the printer in order for it to function again.
CAUTION:
The Format Disk option performs a disk initialization for the entire disk. The operating 
system, firmware files, and third party files (among other files) are completely lost. HP does not 
recommend this action.
Partial Clean
The Partial Clean option erases all partitions and data on the disk drive, except for the firmware 
repository where a backup copy of the firmware file is stored. This allows the disk drive to be 
reformatted without having to download a firmware upgrade file to return the printer to a bootable 
state.
Characteristics of a Partial Clean
●
Customer-defined settings, third-party solutions, firmware files, and the operating system are 
deleted.
●
Rebooting the printer restores the firmware files from the Repository location, but does not restore 
any customer-defined settings.
●
For previous HP printers, a Hard Disk Initialization is similar to executing the Partial Clean function 
for this printer.
CAUTION:
HP recommends backing-up printer configuration data before executing a Partial Clean to 
retain customer-defined settings (if needed). See the Backup/Restore item in the Device Maintenance 
menu.

Power on troubleshooting
Learn about power on troubleshooting.
Power-on checks
Learn about power-on checks.
The basic printer functions should start up when the printer is connected into an electrical outlet and 
the power switch is pushed to the on position. If the printer does not start, use the information in this 
section to isolate and solve the problem.
If the control panel display remains blank, random patterns display, or asterisks remain on the control 
panel display, perform power-on checks to find the cause of the problem.
Power on troubleshooting overview
Learn about general power on troubleshooting.
During normal operation, a cooling fan begins to spin briefly after the printer power is turned on. Place 
a hand over the fan intake vents located on the right-side cover. When the fan is correctly operating, air 
passing into the printer is felt. Lean close to the printer to hear the fan operating. If the fan is operating, 
the dc side of the power supply is functioning.
After the fan is operating, the main motor turns on (unless the top cover is open, a jam condition is 
sensed, or the paper-path sensors are damaged). Visually and audibly determine that the main motor is 
turned on.
If the fan and main motor are operating correctly, the next troubleshooting step is to isolate print engine, 
formatter, and control panel problems. Perform an engine test. If the formatter is damaged, it might 
interfere with the engine test. If the engine-test page does not print, try removing the formatter, and then 
performing the engine test again. If the engine test is then successful, the problem is almost certainly 
with the formatter, the control panel, or the cable that connects them.
Troubleshooting power-on or blank control panel problems
If the printer is not powering on correctly, use the following steps to begin troubleshooting the problem.
1.
Verify that power is available to the printer. If the printer is plugged into a surge protector or 
uninterruptible power supply (UPS), remove it. Plug the printer directly into a known operating wall 
receptacle (make sure that the wall receptacle provides the correct voltage and current for the 
printer).
NOTE:
Unplug any other devices on the same circuit that the printer is using.
2.
Try another known operating wall receptacle and a different power cord.
3.
To eliminate a thermal switch issue, unplug the power cord and leave it unplugged for over 20 
minutes. Re-attach the power cord, and then turn the power on again.
4.
During normal operation, a cooling fan or fans begin to spin briefly after the printer power is turned 
on. Place a hand over the cover vent or vents to feel air passing out of the printer. Lean close to

the printer to hear the fan or fans operating. Look for illuminated lights on the control panel and 
formatter LEDs.
NOTE:
Operational fans, motors, and control-panel lights indicate the following:
●
AC power is present at the printer.
●
The power supply is providing either or both 24 Vdc and 5 Vdc voltages.
●
The DC controller microprocessor is functioning.
5.
If the printer powers on, but the control panel is blank, make sure that the control-panel display wire 
harness or harnesses and flat flexible cable or cables (FFCs) are connected.
NOTE:
The following conditions indicate that the printer has frozen while in Sleep mode or Sleep 
delay. Opening a door or pressing a control-panel button should cause the printer to wake up from 
Sleep mode or Sleep delay.
●
The control panel home button LED is illuminated
●
The power-switch LED flashes once every three to five seconds
If the control panel is not responding, or if it appears black or blank, try the following:
a.
Turn the printer power off, and then on again.
b.
Verify that the system is correctly functioning by printing a test page. Does the test page print 
correctly?
Is the printer HP Embedded Web Server (EWS) accessible?
c.
Verify that the control panel is correctly functioning. If it is not, turn the printer off and 
reseat the control-panel assembly cable connections at the control-panel assembly and the 
formatter.
d.
Try upgrading the firmware. If the firmware upgrade fails to resolve the problem, and the 
printer still freezes while in Sleep mode or Sleep delay, elevate the case.
e.
If the error persists and the EWS functions correctly, replace the control-panel assembly.
6.
If normal start-up noises are not heard, turn the printer off, and then remove any installed 
accessories (for example, envelope feeders, paper feeders, or output accessories).
7.
Turn the printer on, and then listen for start-up noises. If normal start-up noises are heard, the 
problem might be with an accessory.
8.
Perform an engine test. The engine test procedure varies by printer, so refer to the printer Service 
Manual to get instructions.
Troubleshooting power-on or blank control panel problems

--- PAGE 310 ---
9.
If the engine test page prints, the print engine is operating normally. Replace the formatter.
CAUTION:
Under NO circumstances should a formatter from a different printer be installed during 
the repair or troubleshooting processes. The formatter stores important data specific to the model 
of printer it is installed in and is not designed to be swapped or repurposed in any way. Return a 
used formatter to HP.
Issues that can occur from swapping a formatter include:
●
Serial number, product number, product name, page count, and supported cartridges 
information change and might make a product unusable
●
33.02.01 Used board/Disk installed errors
If a used formatter is installed and causes this issue, the partner must cover the costs of the 
repair in the form of a product replacement. There is no method in the field to recover a printer 
where a used formatter is installed.
For more information, see the following topic:
●
HP internal link: 33.02.01 error or printer name and/or product number changes after replacing 
the formatter
●
HP external partner link: 33.02.01 error or printer name and/or product number changes after 
replacing the formatter
To access the HP partner link, you must first log in to the HP Partner First Portal and then connect 
to WISE.
NOTE:
If the engine test page does not print, turn the printer off, reconnect the formatter power 
connector, remove the embedded MultiMedia Card (eMMC), and then try the engine test again. If 
the page prints, the problem might be the eMMC.
10.
If after replacing the formatter or eMMC normal start-up noises are still not heard, replace the DC 
controller.
11.
If the print engine appears to be correctly operating (the engine test page successfully printed) and 
the control panel is still blank, replace the power supply.
Engine diagnostics
Learn about internal engine diagnostics that help in troubleshooting print quality, paper path, noise, 
assembly, and timing issues.
Engine test
Learn about troubleshooting the printer using the engine test diagnostic.
When the engine test is performed, a test page with lines prints if the engine is functioning correctly.
NOTE:
Depending on printer models, either a simplex engine test page, a duplex engine test page, or 
both simplex and duplex engine test pages might be available.
Use a small pointed object to depress and hold the engine test button (location varies depending on the 
printer model). An engine test page prints. The test page can use only Tray 2 as the paper source, so 
make sure that paper is loaded in Tray 2.

Remote Admin
Learn about the printer Remote Admin function.
The Remote Admin feature allows remote access the printer Pre-boot menu (BIOS environment). The 
printer functions as a telnet server which uses the telnet networking protocol to transmit text data. Any 
computer (with telnet installed and enabled) can function as the telnet client to remotely display and 
interact with the Pre-boot menu.
IMPORTANT:
While the Remote Admin function allows remote access the Pre-boot menu, for security 
reasons the Remote Admin connection must be initiated by a person that is physically present at the 
printer.
308
Chapter 4  Solve problems


--- PAGE 335 ---
Required software and network connection
Before using the Remote Admin feature, make sure that the telnet network protocol is installed and 
enabled on the remote telnet client computer.
NOTE:
This section describes enabling and configuring the telnet feature for computers using a 
Windows® operating system.
HP recommends that the telnet client computer be a Windows-based system; however, there are 
other operating systems that support the telnet network protocol. For information about enabling and 
configuring the telnet network protocol for other operating systems, see the owner's manual for that 
operating system.
Enable the Windows telnet client
All computers using the Windows operating system have the telnet client installed, however, the telnet 
client function might not be enabled by default.
NOTE:
The figures and menus in this section are for the Windows 10® operating system. Screens and 
menu selections might vary slightly for other operating systems.
1.
Use the Start menu to open the Windows Settings dialog box, and then search for Turn Windows 
features on or off. Click the Turn Windows features on or off item.

Network connection
The remote telnet client computer must have direct network access to the printer for the Remote Admin 
function to operate. This means that the telnet client computer must be on the same network as the 
printer.
The Remote Admin function cannot be accessed through a network firewall or other remote access 
network security programs.
If a private network is not accessible, ask the network administrator to set up a virtual private network 
(VPN) connection to the network.
Connect a remote connection
Use the following procedures to connect a remote connection.
Start the telnet server function at the printer
For security reasons the Remote Admin feature must be initiated by a person that is physically present 
at the printer. The following steps must be performed by a person that is physically present at the printer.
NOTE:
This person might need to sign in with an administrator or service password depending on how 
the printer is configured.

Cause
Solution
The correct size paper is not loaded.
Load the correct size paper.
The input tray is empty.
Load paper in the input tray.
The correct paper type for the input tray is not selected in the 
printer control panel.
From the printer control panel, select the correct paper type 
for the input tray. Trays configured for a paper type with a 
specific weight range will not match a print job that specifies 
an exact weight, even if the specified weight is within the 
weight range.
Paper from a previous jam has not been completely removed.
Open the printer and remove any paper in the paper path. 
Closely inspect the fuser area for jams.
None of the optional trays appear as input tray options.
The optional trays only display as available if they are installed. 
Verify that any optional trays are correctly installed. Verify 
that the printer driver has been configured to recognize the 
optional trays.
An optional tray is incorrectly installed.
Print a configuration page to confirm that the optional tray is 
installed. If not, verify that the tray is correctly attached to the 
printer.
The paper size is not configured correctly for the input tray.
Print a configuration page or use the control panel to 
determine the paper size for which the tray is configured.
The guides in the tray are not against the paper.
Verify that the guides are touching the paper.
Output is curled or wrinkled
Review the following information when the output is curled or wrinkled.
Table 4-32 Output is curled or wrinkled
Cause
Solution
Paper does not meet the specifications for this printer.
Use only paper that meets the HP paper specifications for this 
printer. Non-recycled, 75 g/m2 (20 lb) paper is optimal for office 
use.
The correct paper type for the input tray is not selected in the 
printer control panel.
From the printer control panel, select the correct paper type 
for the input tray. Trays configured for a paper type with a 
specific weight range will not match a print job that specifies 
an exact weight, even if the specified weight is within the 
weight range.
Paper is damaged or in poor condition.
Remove paper from the input tray and load paper that is in 
good condition.
The printer is operating in an excessively humid environment.
Verify that the printing environment is within humidity 
specifications.
The print job consist of large, solid-filled areas.
Large, solid-filled areas can cause excessive curl. Try using a 
different pattern.
Paper used was not stored correctly and might have absorbed 
moisture.
Remove paper and replace it with paper from a fresh, 
unopened package. Store paper in a plastic bag to protect it 
from humidity.
Paper has poorly cut edges.
Remove paper, flex it, rotate it 180 degrees or turn it over, 
and then reload it into the input tray. Do not fan paper. If the 
problem persists, replace the paper.
Output is curled or wrinkled
427


--- PAGE 454 ---
Table 4-32 Output is curled or wrinkled (continued)
Cause
Solution
The specific paper type was not configured for the tray or 
selected in the software.
Configure the software for the paper (see the software 
documentation). Configure the tray for the paper.
The paper has previously been used for a print job.
Do not re-use paper.
The printer does not pick up paper
If the printer does not pick up paper from the tray, try these solutions.
NOTE:
Tray 1 and Tray 2 are optimal for paper pickup when using special paper or media other than 
20lb plain paper. For Tray 1 and Tray 2 the printer increases the number of attempts to pick up a page, 
which increases the reliability of successfully picking the page from the tray and decreases the 
possibility of a mispick jam.
HP recommends using Tray 1 or Tray 2 if the printer is experiencing excessive or reoccurring jams from 
trays other than Tray 1 and Tray 2, or for print jobs that require media other than 20lb plain paper.
1.
Open the printer and remove any jammed sheets of paper.
2.
Load the tray with the correct size of paper for the job.
3.
Make sure the paper size and type are set correctly on the printer control panel.
4.
Make sure the paper guides in the tray are adjusted correctly for the size of paper. Adjust the 
guides to the appropriate indentation in the tray.
5.
Check the printer control panel to see if the printer is waiting for an acknowledgment to the feed

Image-quality troubleshooting
Learn about image-quality troubleshooting.
Use the information in this topic to troubleshoot and resolve image-quality (what you see on the final 
printed page) problems including copy-quality, print-quality, and color problems (color printers only).
Various printer hardware problems can cause image-quality defects. This topic is a guide to the steps 
used to isolate the specific areas of the printer that are causing image-quality defects on the printed 
page, and to provide solutions to resolve those image-quality defects.
Image-quality problems are defined as:
●
Print-quality (PQ) problems: PQ problems are associated with the print engine (printer base) of an 
MFP printer (single function non MFP image-quality problems are always PQ defects). PQ defects 
appear on pages that are printed by the print engine and not fed through an integrated scanner 
assembly (ISA).
●
Copy-quality (CQ) problems: CQ problems are associated with the integrated-scanner assembly 
(ISA) portion of an MFP printer. CQ defects appear on pages that are copied using the document 
feeder or flatbed glass.
If the print defect is already known to be a PQ or CQ problem, skip to the appropriate troubleshooting 
topic listed below. Otherwise, follow the steps in the next section below to get started troubleshooting 
image-quality problems.
●
Print-quality (PQ) problems: See Print-quality troubleshooting on page 431.
●
Copy-quality (CQ) problems: See Copy-quality troubleshooting on page 446.
Get started troubleshooting image-quality problems
Print a demonstration page to identify the defect as a PQ (print engine ) or CQ (ISA) problem.
NOTE:
If the image defect appears on the printed demonstration page, the issue is a print-quality (PQ) 
problem (associated with the print engine and not the document feeder or flatbed glass) and not a CQ 
problem.
Make sure that the demonstration page is printed on plain paper.
Enterprise printers
1.
Select Reports > Other pages.
2.
Select Demonstration Page.
Pro printers
1.
At the printer, scroll to or select Setup.
2.
Go to Reports, and then select Demonstration Page.
Does the demonstration page show any image-quality defects?
●
Yes: If defects appear on the printed demonstration page the issue is PQ related. See Print-quality 
troubleshooting on page 431.
●
No: If defects does not appear on the printed demonstration page the issue is CQ related. See 
Copy-quality troubleshooting on page 446.

Learn about the print-quality troubleshooting.
NOTE:
Print-quality (PQ) problems are associated with the print engine (printer base) of an MFP

Repetitive image defect ruler
Review the following information about a repetitive image defect ruler.
When troubleshooting the source of some print image defects, one solution is to identify if it is a 
repetitive defect (does the print quality defect appear multiple times on the printed page?). If this is 
the case, use a ruler to measure occurrences of repetitive image defects to help solve image-quality 
problems. For more information, see Using a ruler to measure between repetitive defects.
Use a ruler to measure occurrences of repetitive image defects to help solve image-quality problems. 
Place the ruler next to the first occurrence of the defect on the page. Find the distance between identical 
defects and use the table below to identify the component that is causing the defect.
CAUTION:
Do not use solvents or oils to clean rollers. Instead, rub the roller with a lint-free cloth. If dirt 
is difficult to remove, rub the roller with a lint-free cloth that has been dampened with water.
NOTE:
The primary charging roller, photosensitive drum, and developer roller cannot be cleaned 
because they are internal assemblies in the toner cartridge or imaging drum. If one of these 
assemblies is causing the defect, replace the toner cartridge. The primary fuser sleeve unit or 
pressure roller cannot be cleaned because they are internal assemblies in the fuser. If one of these 
assemblies is causing the defect, replace the fuse.
TIP:
To make a printer specific repetitive defect ruler, use a metric ruler to transfer the measurements 
in the table below to a transparency or the edge of a piece of paper—clearly label each ruler mark with 
the associated defective assembly.

Use a ruler to measure between repetitive defects
The figures in this section show color repetitive defect pages. However, the process for measuring 
repetitive defects is valid for mono pages.
1.
Identify a repetitive defect on the page.
TIP:
Print a cleaning page to see if that resolves the defect.
NOTE:
Some printers allow loading Letter and A4 media in short-edge-first or long-edge-first 
orientation in the paper trays. When measuring repetitive defects, make sure to place the ruler at 
the leading edge of the page. This is the edge of the page that feeds into the printer first.
The example pages below show the following types of repetitive defects.
●
Lines (callout 1)
●
Smudges (callout 2)
●
Dots or spots (callout 3)

436
Chapter 4  Solve problems


--- PAGE 463 ---
1.
From the Home screen on the printer control panel, select the Reports menu.
2.
Select the Configuration/Status Pages menu.
3.
Select Supplies Status Page, and then select Print to print the page.
Step two: Check supplies status
Check the supplies status report as follows.
1.
Look at the supplies status report to check the percent of life remaining for the toner cartridges 
and, if applicable, the status of other replaceable maintenance parts.
Print quality problems can occur when using a toner cartridge that is at its estimated end of life. 
The supplies status page indicates when a supply level is very low. After an HP supply has reached 
the very low threshold, HP’s premium protection warranty on that supply has ended.
The toner cartridge does not need to be replaced now unless the print quality is no longer 
acceptable. Consider having a replacement available to install when print quality is no longer 
acceptable.
If you determine that you need to replace a toner cartridge or other replaceable maintenance 
parts, the supplies status page lists the genuine HP part numbers.
2.
Check to see if you are using a genuine HP cartridge.
A genuine HP toner cartridge has the word “HP” on it, or has the HP logo on it. For more information 
on identifying HP cartridges go to www.hp.com/go/learnaboutsupplies.

Check paper and the printing environment
Use the following information to check the paper selection and the printing environment.
Step one: Use paper that meets HP specifications
Some print-quality problems arise from using paper that does not meet HP specifications.
●
Always use a paper type and weight that this printer supports.
●
Use paper that is of good quality and free of cuts, nicks, tears, spots, loose particles, dust, wrinkles, 
voids, staples, and curled or bent edges.
Step two: Check supplies status
437


--- PAGE 464 ---
●
Use paper that has not been previously printed on.
●
Use paper that does not contain metallic material, such as glitter.
●
Use paper that is designed for use in laser printers. Do not use paper that is designed only for use in 
Inkjet printers.
●
Use paper that is not too rough. Using smoother paper generally results in better print quality.
Step two: Check the environment
The environment can directly affect print quality and is a common cause of print-quality or paper-
feeding issues. Try the following solutions:
●
Move the printer away from drafty locations, such as open windows or doors, or air-conditioning 
vents.
●
Make sure the printer is not exposed to temperatures or humidity outside of printer specifications.
●
Do not place the printer in a confined space, such as a cabinet.
●
Place the printer on a sturdy, level surface.
●
Remove anything that is blocking the vents on the printer. The printer requires good air flow on all 
sides, including the top.
●
Protect the printer from airborne debris, dust, steam, grease, or other elements that can leave 
residue inside the printer.

Image defects, no matter the cause, can often be resolved using the same steps. Use the following steps 
as a starting point for solving image defect issues.
1.
Reprint the document. Print quality defects can be intermittent in nature or can go away completely 
with continued printing.
2.
Check the condition of the cartridge or cartridges. If a cartridge is in a Very Low state (it has 
passed the rated life), replace the cartridge.
3.
Make sure that the driver and tray print mode settings match the media that is loaded in the tray. 
Try using a different ream of media or a different tray. Try using a different print mode.
4.
Make sure the printer is within the supported operating temperature/humidity range.
5.
Make sure that the paper type, size, and weight are supported by the printer. See the printer 
support page at support.hp.com for a list of the supported paper sizes and types for the printer.

Copy-quality troubleshooting
Learn about copy-quality troubleshooting.
NOTE:
Copy-quality (CQ) problems are associated with the integrated-scanner assembly (ISA) portion 
of an MFP printer. CQ defects appear on pages that are copied using the document feeder or flatbed 
glass.
Identify the location and type of the CQ problem
Resolving CQ problems involves isolating the defect to the document feeder or flatbed glass. 
Comparing printed output between the document feeder and the flatbed glass might determine the 
ISA location that is causing the CQ defect.
NOTE:
If a CQ defect appears on printed output from both the document feeder and the flatbed 
glass, carefully inspect the original source for a print-quality (PQ) problem.

the back side of the page. Copies and/or scans from the flatbed glass look normal. Printouts also look 
normal.
The line or streak might be black or in color, and can also be present on fax or digital send output (for 
example, when using Scan to folder or Scan to email features.
NOTE:
HP has determined that 99% of all lines and streaks on copies made by feeding the original 
documents through the document feeder are caused by debris on the document feeder glass strip. 
Even small specks can cause the light reflected off the original to be distorted, resulting in a line, streak, 
or smudge on copies or scans made from the document feeder.
Even if the document feeder glass strip and/or flatbed glass has been wiped clean, the defect might 
persist. Persistent vertical lines, bands, or streaks when copying from the document feeder might mean 
that the debris causing the print quality are not readily visible and cannot be removed with a quick 
cleaning.
Use the procedures below to resolve persistent lines, bands, or streak copy-quality (CQ) problems.

Light or faint copies (color models)
Learn how to resolve light or faint copy-quality problems.
Are you attempting to copy or scan highlighted text?
NOTE:
When digitally sending or copying highlighted images or text objects, the image might appear 
lighter than expected or does not show up at all with certain brands/types of highlighter pens.
Highlighters come in bright, often fluorescent colors. Fluorescent highlighter inks tend to reflect more 
light than that which is absorbed by the paper source. This reflection might cause the image to not show 
up as well as non-fluorescent colors depending upon the scanner/MFP being used.
The most common color for highlighters is yellow, but many other colors are also found such as pink, 
blue, green, orange, and purples. Yellow is often the preferred color to use when making a photocopy as it 
tends to not produce as much of a shadow on copies or scans.
There are different color and ink properties depending upon the brand of highlighters used. Due to these 
differences, scanning of the images might vary greatly from not being seen at all to changing colors (for 
example, orange highlighter might appear brown in the copy or scan or yellow highlighter might appear 
green).
Automatic color detect
HP has a feature in all FutureSmart (LaserJet Enterprise Series only) printers which automatically 
detects color on each page. Depending upon the amount of color information on a page, the scanner 
might determine the page to be black and white due to a very, very small amount of color which might 
be considered background artifacts. This helps to reduce the file size of sent files as well as toner usage 
on a copied page. You might see small highlighted marks on pages print out in black and white or even 
disappear.
454
Chapter 4  Solve problems


--- PAGE 481 ---
The black and white effect is due to the printer not seeing enough color on the page, in which case the 
whole image is rendered as a black and white page. The highlighted mark disappearing might be due to 
the marker characteristics not being detected by the scanner.
Does the printer have the latest firmware version installed?
No or I don't know.
A Firmware enhancement has been introduced for certain LaserJets to help with the reproduction of 
highlighted images.

Solve performance problems
Review the following information and procedures to solve performance problems.
NOTE:
Tray 1 and Tray 2 are optimal for paper pickup when using special paper or media other than 
75-80gsm (20lb) plain paper. For Tray 1 and Tray 2 the printer increases the number of attempts to pick 
up a page, which increases the reliability of successfully picking the page from the tray and decreases 
the possibility of a mis-pick jam.
HP recommends using Tray 1 or Tray 2 if the printer is experiencing excessive or reoccurring jams from 
trays other than Tray 1 and Tray 2, or for print jobs that require media other than 75-80gsm (20lb) plain 
paper.

Print speeds
Print speed is the number of pages that print in one minute. Print speed depends on different engine-
process speeds or operational pauses between printed pages during normal printer operation. Factors 
that determine the print speed of the printer include the following:
●
Page formatting time
The printer must pause for each page to be formatted before it prints. Complex pages take more 
time to format, resulting in reduced print speed. However, most jobs print at full engine speed.
●
Media size
Legal-size media reduces print speed because it is longer than the standard Letter- or A4–size 
media. A reduce print speed is used when printing on narrow media to prevent the edges of the 
fuser from overheating.
●
Media mode
Some media types require a reduced print speed to achieve maximum print quality on that media. 
For example, glossy, heavy, and specialty media (for example, envelopes or photos) require a 
reduced print speed. To maximize the print speed for special media types, make sure that the 
correct media type in the print driver is selected.
●
Printer temperature
To prevent printer damage, print speed is reduced if the printer reaches a specific internal 
temperature (thermal slow down). The starting temperature of the printer, ambient environment 
temperature, and the print job size effect the number of pages that can be printed before the printer 
reduces the print speed. Thermal slow down reduces print speed by printing four pages and then 
pausing for an amount of time before printing continues.
●
Other print speed reduction factors
Other factors (especially during large print jobs) that can cause reduced print speeds include:
–
Density control sequence; occurs every 150 pages and takes about 120 seconds
The printer does not print
If the printer does not print at all, try the following solutions.

WARNING!
To avoid damage to the printer, turn the printer off, wait 30 seconds, and then remove 
the power cord before attempting to service the printer.
CAUTION:
Under NO circumstances should a formatter from a different printer be installed during 
the repair or troubleshooting processes. The formatter stores important data specific to the model of 
printer it is installed in and is not deigned to be swapped or re-purposed in any way. Return a used 
formatter to HP.
Issues that can occur from swapping a formatter include:
●
Serial number, product number, product name, page count, and supported cartridges information 
change and might make a product unusable.
●
33.02.01 Used board/Disk installed errors.
If a used formatter is installed and causes this issue, the partner must cover the costs of the repair in 
the form of a product replacement. There is no method in the field to recover a printer where a used 
formatter is installed.
IMPORTANT:
Do not replace the formatter, DC controller, and hard-disk drive simultaneously during a 
single printer servicing. Doing so might cause the printer to become unstable or inoperable.

Special installation instructions for a main drive assembly (replacement unit and serviced unit)
●
Replacement unit: A replacement unit is a new assembly that installs in place of a discarded 
in-service unit.
●
In-service unit: An in-service unit is a existing assembly that has been removed for repair or to 
gain access to other assemblies.
CAUTION:
When the main drive assembly is installed (replacement units and service units), the 
front door must be closed.
IMPORTANT:
If you are installing a new main drive assembly (replacement unit), you do not need to 
perform the alignment steps below. New assemblies are already aligned.

Special installation instructions for a main drive assembly (replacement unit and serviced unit)
●
Replacement unit: A replacement unit is a new assembly that installs in place of a discarded 
in-service unit.
●
In-service unit: An in-service unit is a existing assembly that has been removed for repair or to 
gain access to other assemblies.
CAUTION:
When the main drive assembly is installed (replacement units and service units), the 
front door must be closed.
IMPORTANT:
If you are installing a new main drive assembly (replacement unit), you do not need to 
perform the alignment steps below. New assemblies are already aligned.
a.
Replacement unit and in-service unit: On the printer engine, be careful to not depress the 
levers located behind the main drive assembly (when it is installed).

2.
Unpack the replacement part from the packaging.
CAUTION:
 Some parts are sensitive to electrostatic discharge (ESD). Always 
perform service work at an ESD-protected workstation or mat. If an ESD workstation or mat is not 
available, touch the sheet-metal chassis to provide a static ground before touching an ESD-
sensitive assembly. Protect the ESD-sensitive assemblies by placing them in ESD pouches when 
they are out of the printer.
IMPORTANT:
Make sure that all of the shipping materials (for example shipping tape) are removed 
from the replacement part prior to installation.
NOTE:
If the replacement part is a roller or pad, avoid touching the spongy part of it. Skin oils on 
the roller or pad can cause paper pickup and/or print-quality problems. HP recommends using 
disposable gloves when handling rollers or pads or washing your hands before touching rollers or 
pads.

Glossary of terms
 802.11  
802.11 is a set of standards for wireless local area network (WLAN) communication, developed by the 
IEEE LAN/MAN Standards Committee (IEEE 802).
802.11b/g/n  
802.11b/g/n can share the same hardware and use the 2.4 GHz band. 802.11b supports bandwidth up 
to 11 Mbps, 802.11n supports bandwidth up to 150 Mbps. 802.11b/g/n devices might occasionally suffer 
interferences from microwave ovens, cordless telephones, and Bluetooth devices.
AC  
An electric current that reverses its direction many times a second at regular intervals. For example, the 
110V line current found in a typical US electrical wall receptacle.
AC Control Module (PageWide)  
The AC Control Module controls the heating elements in the airflow assembly. Functions include voltage 
monitoring (ensuring correct operation in a low-quality-power environment), isolation (low voltage heater 
control signals are isolated from the high voltage AC power for safety), AC switching (power is switched 
on/off to the heater), and heating element configuration (heating element configuration is changed 
between series and parallel for temperature predictability).
ADF  
An Automatic Document Feeder (ADF) is a device that automatically feeds an original sheet (or multiple 
sheets) of paper into the image scanner. The document feeder is a component of the integrated 
scanner assembly (ADF and image scanner).
Airflow System (PageWide)  
The airflow system conditions the printed pages to avoid page curling due to the ink on the page. The 
airflow system functionally consists of a fan and heating elements. The pressurized air is blown on the 
page through the nozzles that are placed on the paper path of the airflow system between print and 
eject zone.
BOOTP  
Bootstrap Protocol. A network protocol used by a network client to obtain its IP address automatically. 
This is usually done in the bootstrap process of computers or operating systems running on them. The 
BOOTP servers assigns an IP address from a pool of addresses to each client. BOOTP enables “diskless 
workstation” computers to obtain an IP address prior to loading any advanced operating system.
CCD  
A Charged Coupled Device (CCD) is the scanner module which enables a scan job. A CCD locking 
mechanism is used to hold the CCD module to prevent any damage when the printer is moved.
1316
Glossary of terms


--- PAGE 1343 ---
CIS  
A Contact Image Sensor (CIS) scanner captures an image using the printer's optical path. Red, green, 
and blue LEDs sequentially illuminate a small strip of the document (often called a raster line), and the 
optical system captures each color in a single row of Charged Coupled Device (CCD) sensors that cover 
the entire page width.
Collation  
Collation is a process of printing a multiple-copy job in sets. When collation is selected, the device prints 
an entire set before printing additional copies.
Control Panel  
The control panel is a flat, typically vertical panel or screen where the user can control and/or monitor 
the printer. The control panel is found on the front of the printer.
Coverage  
Coverage is the printing term used for a toner usage measurement on printing. For example, 5% 
coverage means that an A4 sided paper has about 5% image or text on it. If the paper or original has 
complicated images or a large amount of text, the coverage will be higher and at the same time, a toner 
usage will be as much as the coverage.
DC  
An electric current flowing in one direction only. Typically, a low voltage load current supplied to an 
electrical assembly.
DCC  
The DC controller (DCC) controls the operation of the printer sub-systems and electrical components. 
the DCC sends out various signals to operate motors, solenoids, and other printer components based 
on the print command and image data that the host computer sends the formatter.
Default  
The value or setting that is in effect when a printer is unboxed, reset, or initialized.
DHCP  
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a client-server networking protocol. A DHCP server 
provides configuration parameters specific to the DHCP client host requesting, generally, information 
required by the client host to participate on an IP network. The DHCP also provides a mechanism for 
allocation of IP addresses to client hosts.
Digital Send Software  
Digital send software allows a mufti-function printer (MFP) to scan and send information quickly and 
securely to email, network folders, other printers, and fax services.
DIMM  
A Dual Inline Memory Module (DIMM) is a small circuit board that holds memory. The DIMM stores all 
data within the printer, such as printing data and received fax data.
DPI  
Dots Per Inch (DPI) is a measurement of resolution that is used for scanning and printing. Generally, 
higher DPI results in a higher resolution (more visible detail in the image and a larger file size).

Duplex  
A mechanism that automatically turns over a sheet of paper so that the printer can print (or scan) on 
both sides of the paper. A printer equipped with a duplex unit can print on both sides of the paper during 
one print cycle.
Duty Cycle  
Duty cycle is the page quantity which does not affect printer performance for a month. Generally, the 
printer has the lifespan limitation such as pages per year. The lifespan means the average capacity of 
print-outs, usually within the warranty period. For example, if the duty cycle is 48,000 pages per month 
the printer limit is 2,400 pages a day (assuming 20 working days/month).
Dynamic Security  
Dynamic Security is a toner cartridge design and process for authenticating genuine HP supplies. HP 
printers use toner cartridges that have security chips or electronic circuitry. Cartridges using a non-HP 
chip, or modified chip, or non-HP circuitry might not work (now or in the future).
e-Duplex  
Single-pass electronic duplex (e-Duplex) printer use two separate scan modules to scan the front-side 
and back-side of an e-duplex copy job page in a single pass through the document feeder.
EMC  
EMC is a measure of a device's ability to operate as intended in its shared operating environment while, 
at the same time, not affecting the ability of other equipment within the same environment to operate as 
intended.
EMI  
EMI is the electromagnetic energy which affects the functioning of an electronic device. Electronic 
devices (like printers) are a source of EMI. Because it is rare for electronics to operate in isolation, 
products are generally engineered to function in the presence of some amount of EMI.
eMMC  
An embedded Multi-Media Card is a compact memory device consisting of NAND flash memory and a 
simple storage controller.
Emulation  
Emulation is a technique of one machine obtaining the same results as another. An emulator duplicates 
the functions of one system with a different system, so that the second system behaves like the first 
system. Emulation focuses on exact reproduction of external behavior. This is different from simulation, 
which concerns an abstract model of the system being simulated, often considering its internal state.
EPS  
Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) is a PostScript (PS) code file which is used for storing font and vector 
graphic image information.
ESD  
An electrostatic discharge (ESD) is a sudden flow of electricity between two electrically charged objects 
caused by contact, an electrical short, or dielectric breakdown. Discharge of built up static electricity.
Ethernet  
Ethernet is a frame-based computer networking technology for local area networks (LANs). It defines 
wiring and signaling for the physical layer, and frame formats and protocols for the media access 
control (MAC)/data link layer of the OSI model. Ethernet is mostly standardized as IEEE 802.3. Ethernet 
has become the most widespread LAN technology in use during the 1990s to present.

Fuser Unit  
The fuser unit is part of a laser printer that adheres the toner onto the printed page. It consists of a 
heat roller and a pressure roller. After toner is transferred onto the paper, the fuser unit applies heat and 
pressure to make sure that the toner stays on the paper permanently (which is why paper is warm when 
it comes out of a laser printer).
Gateway  
A connection between computer networks, or between a computer network and a telephone line. A 
gateway is used to connect two different computer networks, especially a connection to the Internet.
Grayscale

Printer job language (PJL) is an integral part of printer configuration, in addition to the standard PCL 
and PostScript (PS). With standard cabling, the printer can use PJL to perform a variety of functions like 
dynamic I/O switching, context-sensitive switching, and isolation of print environment settings from one 
print job to the next.
PML  
Printer management language (PML) allows remote configuration of the printer and status read-back 
from the printer through the I/O ports.
PostScript (PS)  
PostScript (PS) is a Page Description Language (PDL) and programming language used primarily in 
electronic and desktop publishing. PostScript is run in an interpreter to generate an image.
PPM  
Pages Per Minute (PPM) is a method of measurement for determining how fast a printer works, meaning 
the number of pages a printer can produce in one minute.
Print Media  
Media like paper, envelopes, labels, and transparencies which can be used in a printer, scanner, fax, or 
copier.
Printer Driver  
A program used to send commands and transfer data from the computer to the printer.
Printhead (PageWide)  
The printhead converts the digital firing instructions from the printer electronics into properly formed 
and timed microscopic drops of the four ink colors.

Printhead Wiper (PageWide)  
The printhead wiper system keeps the printhead nozzles firing correctly throughout the life of the printer 
as it performs the wiping and capping functions. The wiping function cleans the nozzles of ink residue 
and particulates. The capping function keeps the nozzles moist during storage and when the printer is 
idle.
Protocol  
A convention or standard that controls or enables the connection, communication, and data transfer 
between two computing endpoints.
RAM  
Random Access Memory (RAM) is the printer memory device where the data in current use is kept so it 
can be quickly retrieved by the device's processor. This memory is an important factor in avoiding errors 
and printing documents properly. Printer memory is used to store, and process print jobs as they are 
sent to the printer from a computer. After printing, the job is cleared from the memory to make room 
for more print jobs. Printer memory is directly linked to two print characteristics: speed and print quality. 
More memory allows you to print faster and print larger, high-quality graphics.
REDI sensor  
An optical reflective edge detection interrupter (REDI) sensor. Usually used in conjunction with mirrors 
to sense the presence or absence of paper in the paper path. These sensors are carefully aligned and 
calibrated at the factory, so care must be taken when servicing these sensors.
Resolution  
The sharpness of an image is measured in Dots Per Inch (DPI). The higher the DPI, the greater the 
resolution.
SCB  
The Scanner Control Board (SCB) controls the functions of the image scanner components in the Sub 
Scanner Assembly (SSA).
Service fluid and aerosol management systems (PageWide)  
There are two types of service fluid, shipping fluid and ink. The service fluid management system is 
contained entirely within the duplex module. Service fluid is discharged as droplets from the printhead, 
and then collected in a container inside the duplex module. Some of the droplets are called aerosol 
because they are lighter than air. Aerosol can float inside the printer and collect on the lens of optical 
sensors, producing false failures. The aerosol management system transports the aerosol and collects 
it in a safe place. Aerosol management consists of an aerosol fan, mounted on the rear wall of the air 
flow assembly, which creates air flow that pulls the aerosol through the holes in the platen and into the 
aerosol filter inside the duplex module.
SFP  
A single-function printer only processes print jobs sent from a host computer or from an USB port on the 
printer.
SMB  
Server Message Block (SMB) is a network protocol mainly applied to share files, printers, serial ports, 
and miscellaneous communications between nodes on a network. SMB also provides an authenticated 
inter-process communication mechanism.

SMTP  
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is the standard for email transmissions across the internet. SMTP 
is a relatively simple, text-based protocol, where one or more recipient of a message is specified, and the 
message text is transferred. It is a client server protocol where the client transmits an email message to 
the server.
SODIMM  
Small outline dual in-line memory module (SODIMM) is a thin profile memory storage device (a smaller 
alternative to a standard DIMM device).
SSA  
The Sub-Scanner Assembly is the image scanner component of the Integrated Scanner Assembly (ISA, 
which includes the document feeder and the image scanner).
Subnet Mask  
The subnet mask is used in conjunction with the network address to determine which part of the 
address is the network address and which part is the host address.
TCP/IP  
The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP) are the set of communications 
protocols that implement the protocol stack on which the internet and most commercial networks run.
TIFF  
Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) is a variable-resolution bit mapped image format. TIFF describes image 
data that typically come from scanners. TIFF images use tags, keywords defining the characteristics 
of the image that is included in the file. This flexible and platform-independent format can be used for 
pictures that have been made by various image processing applications.
Toner Cartridge  
A bottle or container that holds toner, which is used in a machine like a printer. Toner is a powder used 
in laser printers and photocopiers. The toner forms the text and images on printed paper. Toner can be 
fused by a combination of heat/pressure from the fuser, causing it to bind the fibers in the paper.
TPM  
The HP Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a security accessory for printers. The TPM strengthens 
protection of encrypted credentials and data stored on your printer. Certificate private keys are both 
generated by and protected by the TPM. Once installed, the printer and the TPM are sealed, and the 
printer owns the TPM. The TPM may not be moved to another device without losing its ownership from 
the original printer. Installing a TPM accessory might necessitate a firmware upgrade. The TPM prevents 
the printer from starting if the TPM is missing. If the TPM is removed from the printer, a control-panel 
error message appears indicating that the TPM is missing.
NOTE:
The TPM is not a service part for some printer models. Check the printer service manual to determine if 
the TPM is a replaceable service part.
TWAIN  
An industry standard for scanners and software. By using a TWAIN compliant scanner with TWAIN-
compliant software, a scan can be initiated from the program. TWAIN is an image capture API for 
Microsoft Windows and Apple Macintosh operating systems.

URL  
Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is the global address of documents and resources on the internet. The 
first part of the address indicates what protocol to use. The second part specifies the IP address or the 
domain name where the resource is located.
USB  
Universal Serial Bus (USB) is a standard that was developed by the USB Implementers Forum, Inc., to 
connect computers and peripherals. Unlike the parallel port, USB is designed to concurrently connect a 
single computer USB port to multiple peripherals.
Walk-up USB  
Some printers support direct printing from a USB flash drive (the walk-up USB port is usually near the 
control panel).
Watermark  
A watermark is a recognizable image or pattern in paper that appears lighter when viewed by 
transmitted light. Watermarks were first introduced in Bologna, Italy in 1282. Watermarks have been 
used by paper makers to identify their product, and also on postage stamps, currency, and other 
government documents to discourage counterfeiting.
XPS  
XML Paper Specification (XPS) is a specification for a Page Description Language (PDL) and a new 
document format developed by Microsoft. This has benefits for portable document and electronic 
documents. It is an XML-based specification based on a new print path and vector-based, device-
independent document format.
ZIF Connector  
Zero insertion force (ZIF) connectors use a mechanical locking method to secure Flat Flexible Cables 
(FFCs) to a Printed Circuit Assembly (PCA).
